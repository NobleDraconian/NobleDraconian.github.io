    <h3> Dragon Engine </h3>
    <p>
		Dragon Engine is a microservice-based game framework designed for Roblox. It offers many features including
		network abstraction, run-time module dependency resolution, easy API-based code communication, and more.
		<br>
		This framework powers a lot of my projects, and is overall very robust and portable. It lets me rapidly prototype systems and gameplay.

    <h3> Visions of a perspective reality </h3>
    <p>
		Visions of a perspective reality was a gamejam project for the 2020 Roblox Developers Conference. Participants of the gamejam were given 24 hours
		to make a game based on the theme "2020 vision". The game features unique ambient levels, and a "perspective" switching mechanic where you have to
		switch between the 2nd and 3rd dimensions to navigate through various puzzles to reach the goal.
		<br>
		The game won the title of "Most creative gameplay" in the gamejam. I handled the programming, game design, and UI. My partner handled the modeling and level design,
		as well as the game's art design.

	  <h3> Creamatoria </h3>
	  <p>
		  Creamatoria is one of my first attempts at creating an immersive world, which tells its story through the environment the player
		  walks through, or "atmospheric storytelling". It features a unique atmosphere, potraying a desolate landscape with long abandoned
		  structures of what was once a habited planet.

	  <h3> Kingdoms Online </h3>
	  <p>
		  Kingdoms Online is a midieval mmorpg project I briefly worked on with a team consisting of 5 people. I had to coordinate with other programmers on a daily basis, conforming to
		  an AGILE project schedule. I implemented a datastore system that automatically backed up player data, and locked their data to a single session.

	  <h3> Project FreshCo </h3>
	  <p>
		  Project freshco is an online pvp game that features
		  wacky/cartoony antics combined with melee combat (throwing weapons, blocking
		  with them, and attacking with them).
		  <br>
		  I had to solve a lot of technical problems to make this game come to fruition. Examples include figuring out how to responsively handle melee combat
		  networking (blocking another player's attacks when latency is involved), switching network ownership of item projectiles, dynamically running and stopping item logic, and more.
		  <br>
		  This is my current project, and is currently in the pre-alpha stage of development. I post updates occasionally about the project 
		  on my <a href="https://twitter.com/Noble_Draconian">twitter account</a>.
