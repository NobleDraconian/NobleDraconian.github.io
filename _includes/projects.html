    <h3> Dragon Engine </h3>
    <p>
		Dragon Engine is a microservice-based game framework designed for Roblox. It offers many features including
		network abstraction, run-time module dependency resolution, easy API-based code communication, and more.
		<br>
		This framework powers a lot of my projects, and is overall very robust and portable. It lets me rapidly prototype systems and gameplay.

    <h3> Visions of a perspective reality </h3>
    <p>
		Visions of a perspective reality was a gamejam project for the 2020 Roblox Developers Conference. Participants of the gamejam were given 24 hours
		to make a game based on the theme "2020 vision". The game features unique ambient levels, and a "perspective" switching mechanic where you have to
		switch between the 2nd and 3rd dimensions to navigate through various puzzles to reach the goal.
		<br>
		The game won the title of "Most creative gameplay" in the gamejam. I handled the programming, game design, and UI. My partner handled the modeling and level design,
		as well as the game's art design.
